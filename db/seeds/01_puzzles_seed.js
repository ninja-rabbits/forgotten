There aren’t any clues as to which one might lead to an exit. You feel so alone. There hasn’t been a sound in the tunnels since the crashing bang you heard what feels like hours ago. None of this makes any sense and you have no idea how to figure it out. You can’t just stand there, so you start running down the tunnel straight ahead of you. It’s just as empty as the one you came from. Nothing but dirt, wood, and fluorescent lights. It’s disorienting to see nothing else for what feels like a half an hour.

Frustration wells up inside you at the thought of how little you know. You feel so trapped.

You reach for the phone and you have to fight the urge to throw it as hard as you can against the wall. You don’t need another puzzle, you need answers. You open the contact information of the sender and press “Call”. To your surprise, the call is picked up on the second ring. At first you hear nothing.

Each building designed exactly according to the specifications you and your team designated. It’s surreal to see it for the first time. A decade of planning and now you’re finally here. The anticipation is intense. Will you succeed? You can’t know yet, but you think you will. This can’t all have been for nothing. Your eyes snap open and it’s as if your memories have hit a wall. What was the compound built to do? You can’t remember. The memory has left you with an intense sense of purpose. You have to get out of this tunnel. You have to save those screaming people. Somehow it’s all up to you now. You start running down the passage again. Hunger has begun to gnaw at your stomach and your mouth is so dry that it hurts to draw breath as you move as quickly as you can. What if this tunnel was the wrong choice? You could die down here, you realize, and quickly without food or water. You can’t keep running down this passage forever. Although, it has to end sometime, doesn’t it? You run for what seems like an hour, though you have no way of knowing. At that thought, you see a wall start to come into focus in front of you. You’re so frusterated. You stop for a minute to think, but you quickly understand that there is nothing you can do except head back the way you came. You eventually make it back to the fork in the passage and you try the next tunnel. Your legs and lungs are burning and you’re not sure how much longer you can keep going like this. After a few minutes you trip over something and go sprawling across the floor. Flesh grinding against the unforgiving packed dirt. You get up slowly, noting the blood now trickling from long scrapes across your left calf and forearm. Cursing, you limp over to the object on the ground. It’s mostly buried and you can’t immediately make out what it is. You get out the knife and begin to chip away the very solid ground around it. It’s a while before you start to make any real progress, but when you do you realize you’re digging up a small metal lockbox. You don’t want to waste time on this if it’s nothing, but you’re lost and unsure of what else to do. You continue digging until the box can be opened. To your dismay, you see that lock requires a three digit password. It seems pretty flimsy though, so you take off one of your shoes and slam it down hard against the latch. Nothing. You try again.

Your eyes scan your surroundings a little better as you run through the tunnel, not wanting to land face first in the dirt again. After a few minutes, you see it. A door. You walk up to it and try the knob. To your surprise, it turns and you begin to push it open. As you do you look ahead and notice more doors along the tunnel in front of you. You decide to see what’s behind this one first. You push it open into what looks like someone’s bedroom, although it’s incredibly stark. There is one small, metal framed bed with a green, army-issue blanket neatly folded on top of it to one side.

He’s coming over to you to take a piece of bread from your hand. He laughs as he tears off a corner and throws into to the group of ducks that has gathered at the water’s edge in front of him. It’s a calm summer day and you are so happy. Your eyes snap open as you think back to the plane. You felt older in that memory and Charlie was definitely not with you. Who is he? Your son? How could you have a son and not remember him? An incredible sadness washes over you, but you don’t know why. Where is he now? Is he safe? You have to find out. You push open the door and you see a room very similar to the one you were just in. Though the bed in this room is unkempt, the blanket nearly falling off the bed in a spraw. The desk too, is covered in paper and open books. But what really catches your attention are the pictures on the wall. Nothing more than frameless prints tacked to the concrete, but nearly all of them featuring Charlie. You and Charlie. His arms reaching up to you. Charlie running next to a small brown puppy. A baby Charlie in a high chair, laughing, with something blue smeared all over his face. You look for a long time, gazing into that perfect face. You tear your eyes away for a moment to examine the desk. Most of the papers and books use that same strange code as the papers in your backpack, but a black and white photo catches his attention. It looks like it it was cut from a newspaper. It’s a shot of a tombstone. The text carved into it reads: Charles Milo Ender, Beloved. You sink into the chair next to the desk. No. This can’t be him. It can’t. You sit there a long time. You can’t move. You can’t breathe. Then you remember the last message you received. “If you don’t hurry we are all going to die. Every single one of us. Including him.” Could he be alive? What is happening? If you could only remember. The frustration starts taking over again and you throw your head back in rage. When you do, you notice something on the ceiling. A trapdoor. Is this a way out? You scramble on top of the chair and you can barely reach the latch. It won’t budge.

    problem: 'What means something to you but not to me?',
    solution: 'Your life',
    story_pop_up: 'This is getting ridiculous. Continuous puzzles, lost memories, foul sarcasm… Your patience is running thin and yet it seems like you have no choice but to play along. You look at the main entrance door. A thick iron door with a small barred slider-type peephole and three heavy locks, either of which clearly haven’t been used in years, however were still in a rather good shape. The door is covered in rust and moss. It’s apparent to you that there is no point in even trying to get out through that door. The windows beside it are also barred and only add to the sense of wonder of true purpose of such level of security. You wander through an arch, into what appears to be the main living room of the house. A very old tv beside a closed chimney, a couch and a couple of sofas, a door leading to some room, a small greenhouse attached to the living room. Nothing seems to be too out of ordinary except… Someone is sitting in one of the chairs in the greenhouse! Your heart is pounding and you can feel cold sweat going down your spine as you start slowly walking towards broad foggy glass doors that lead to the greenhouse. Is that the person who is sending the messages?.. You’re standing right behind the glass doors now, breathing heavily. You can’t really see clearly through the glass, but you definitely can make out a shape of a person. It feels like the time has stopped, your hands can’t stop shaking. Nevertheless, you gather all your strength, reach for the doorknob and forcibly open the door...Your heart skips a beat and your whole body staggers for a moment as you fall into a shock. What sitting in the chair is a doll. A human sized doll made out of random scrap and partially covered with leather. However, before you are able to fully understand what is it that you see in front of you, a vibration in your pocket breaks the dead silence in the room.',

    problem: 'I live above a star, but I do not burn. I have 11 friends, but they do not turn. I am visited in sequence; never, once, or repeatedly. My initials are PQRS. What am I?',
    solution: '7',
    story_pop_up: 'You unwillingly send the answer back. You’re sick of riddles and puzzles coming your way, but for some reason, something inside you tells you that it is absolutely necessary to keep on solving the stupid problems. There was a follow up message this time however, which simply said “2nd floor”. You guess that is where you need to be headed next. Also what did the sender mean by ‘crossing some rules’? What rules? Is this some sort of game? You tell yourself that it is time to act, whether it is of a will of your own or of the unknown sender. You see a stairway to your right, leading to the second floor. Without hesitation you run up the stairs and end up in a wide hall with a balcony, which is unsurprisingly also heavily barred. You take a quick scan of the floor and realize that it is definitely of a different design. A long corridor with a sharp turn, that leads to a few rooms and another room just by the stairs, is all there is. You decide to check that room first as it is closest to you, hoping to find something… You don’t even know what exactly, but it clearly feels like the sender wants you to find it. As you run up to the first room’s door and about to turn the handle, you glimpse over a small sign on the room with a number on it. A shiver goes down your spine as you read ‘88’. The same as one of the numbers on the small piece of paper that you’re still holding in your hand. You take a step back and try think everything through. What is going on? you think and run down the corridor to check the numbers on other doors. It all matches up, every room number corresponds to every number on the piece of paper, except 0. What does this mean? As soon as you get back to the room ‘88’ your phone vibrates, you quickly grab it and check the new message.',

    problem: 'The man who invented it doesn’t want it for himself. The man who bought it, doesn’t need it for himself. The man who needs it, doesn’t know it when he needs it.',
    solution: 'coffin',
    story_pop_up: 'That was rather morbid. The sick sense of humor makes you feel uneasy and annoyed, but you just play along. You have to, it seems. You take a look at the numbers written on the piece of paper once again, and decide that the ones that have a red circle around, are the rooms that you will check. You come back to the room ‘88’. The door is yet to be opened. You’re feeling a little anxious yet terrified of what might be behind the door. You put your shaking hand on the knob and gently turn it as you slowly exhale. You slide the door open as it makes a dreadful squeaking sound. To your surprise, the spacious room contained nothing but a thick layer of dust on the floor, fungus spreading on the walls and small child size shoe in the center. You come closer to the small loafer and notice something glistening inside of it, a key? As you bend down to closer inspect the item, the silence is interrupted by the aggravating, familiar creak of the door. You freeze. You feel someone’s intense stare drilling through the back of your head. Someone’s watching you… Someone is in the doorway. You gather all your might, take a slow but deep breath and sharply turn around. Unfortunately whoever or whatever was in the doorway, shut the door too quickly for you to get a good look, however you were still able to make out a somewhat disfigured shape of a dark body. You run up to the door and try to open it but it won’t budge. ‘Is he holding the door?’ you think. Right at that moment you feel a buzz in your pocket.',
    message_pop_up: 'Hmm… I wonder why you hesitated entering that room? Perhaps you’re sharper than I thought you are. So many rooms… so many possibilities… Some of them have answers, some of them have, let’s say, happy surprises!

    problem: 'What hides in water, and waits in glass, and when you leave doesn’t last? It may only be seen, never felt, and has every bruise and bash you’ve been dealt!',
    solution: 'reflection',
    story_pop_up: 'As you send the response back, you immediately get a hold of the handle and quickly open the door, anxious to meet the one who closed it. However no one or nothing was in sight. The same well lit wide hall and a corridor. No one is here but you. You decide to waste no more time and run back inside the room, grab the old, rusty key from the shoe and go straight to the next room on your list, number 47. Without any hesitation you slam the door open. The room is not as empty as the last one. A rather small bed in the corner with nothing but a mattress on it, a little nightstand right next to it. A couple of boxes  lying around with some scrap in them, and a lunchbox on a desk to your left. The only source of lighting in the room is the single window opposite to the door. Nothing seems interesting enough or worth your time, except the lunchbox, so you come closer to inspect it. The small grey metallic box has a 3-digit combination lock on it. Your first thought is to use the pocket knife to force your way inside, however the box, so is the lock, appears to be sturdy enough to sustain that sort of damage. You gently shake the box and hear a clunking sound. A coin? Or perhaps another key? Before you are able to think of a possible combination to unlock the box, you feel a vibration in your pocket. Another message. By now you’ve stopped wondering or questioning the sender or the messages, you just go along with the usual procedure.',

    solution: '328',
    story_pop_up: 'You use the numbers as the combination for the lock. You hear a slight clicking sound. The lock loosens up so you remove it from the box. You open the container and find another key! Two keys? For what? And then it hits you… The main entrance door has 3 heavy locks hanging on it. You realize that perhaps these old iron keys could be used to open them? You spring up with excitement and run into the corridor, however after running through it back and forth, there is no room 0 in sight. Luckily you quickly remember spotting a door next to the couch in the living room with, now that you think about, a faint red circle on it. Was that room 0? You’re getting restless. The way out is finally in sight. All that is left is to find the last key, which hopefully is hidden inside the last room on your list. You start running down the stairs, but before reaching the ground floor you stagger as horror creeps into every single part of your body. You can feel your own heartbeat pulsing inside of your brain. Your throat instantly dries out, making every slow compressed breath you take insanely painful. The doll… The human sized doll is gone. It’s no longer idly sitting in the chair inside the greenhouse. What the hell is going on? Who moved it? Was it the person who shut the door? A dreadful thought crosses your mind, “Was the doll the one who shut the door?..”. You try to make out a nervous smile as a few droplets of cold sweat run down your neck. Or was the doll ever there?.. As that last thought crosses your mind, you hear heavy footsteps behind you coming from the second floor. Your heart starts pounding and is about to break out of your rib cage. Your ears start to get clogged up and your vision is getting blurry. At this very moment a vibration in your pocket sends a shock throughout your body. You get a hold of yourself and quickly take out your phone and read the first line of the message: “RUN”. Without taking a look behind you, you sprint down the remaining stairs, cross the living room and barge into a pitch black room 0, locking the door behind you. After catching your breath for a few split seconds you read the rest of the message.',

You put your ear against the door and try to listen for any distinct sounds that could identify anyone’s presence, but you hear nothing. You listen for a few more seconds and then decide to look for the last key. Your surroundings make it seem like the room had been used as a storage. Dozens of boxes with old clothes, used irons and small wooden toys. A small old bookcase with dozens of books is fixed to the wall opposite to the door that you are leaning against. You start browsing through boxes, jolting any containers and pouches you find, however you find nothing but random rubbish, dust and old clothes half devoured by moths.

The sentences resonate with you. You close your eyes and try to remember why this is so familiar to you… “Matthew 16:19” rolls of your tongue. This hint… This hint you just received, it’s a verse from The Bible. Matthew 16:19… You didn’t think of yourself as much of a religious person, how could you? You still can’t fully remember who you really are. But somehow the name of the verse just came to your head. You spring up and start going through the bookcase title by title until you find a thick, leather covered, laced book covered in spider web and dust. Here it is, The Bible. Surprisingly, the book pages got preserved fairly well, considering how old The Bible looks. You quickly flip through the pages to get to the verse and there it is, neatly taped right on top of Matthew 16:19, an old iron key. You gently take it off the page and close the book and put it back in its place, all while thanking God, who frankly you did not expect yourself addressing any time soon. You walk up to the door and slowly open it, creating a small gap, which lets you scout the living room. There is no one in sight. The presence of whatever that thing was is gone, for now at least. You fully open the door and swiftly make your way to the main entrance. The main entrance looks as impenetrable as ever, however now you have all that you need to get through. After a couple of trials, you manage to unlock the first lock. Now the second... You are very close. Your heart is pounding again, but now excitement. Last lock. You insert the third key and turn it. The lock makes a loud metallic snapping sound that fills you with joy and relief. You turn the huge iron handle and… nothing. The door won’t move. It’s still locked. You can feel life force leaving your body. All of your hopes start to crumble into small little pieces. You fall on your knees while still holding onto the rusty handle. The usual, by now, vibration from the phone interrupts your pondering.',
